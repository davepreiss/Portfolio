          <figcaption class="thumbnailSubText"><a href=" https://youtu.be/_z525dePLJk">Putting the video at the top because it will make the following more understandable.</a> Flatness and parallelism are GD&T terms used to describe the form and orientation of a surface, in the case of parallelism, with respect to another another ideal datum surface. Both are typically measured by laying a part on a surface plate and running a dial indicator across its surface, where the dial indicator is grounded in planar contact with the surface plate. Any deviation you see in the dial indicator is indicative of the part's flatness and/or parallelism with respect to the surface plate. There's a problem with this method though, which is that it can be difficult to separate when you're seeing flatness vs parallelism. Without spotting a reasonably flat plane within your data, it's possible to mistake a lack of parallelism for a lack of flatness.
            <div class="modalOnly">
              <p>CMM's are typically used to separate these two measurements where XYZ point collection are all automated, and then a plane is fit to the inspected surface. You can effectively achieve the same thing by plotting your points in a spreadsheet, but I wanted to build some hardware to automate XYZ point collection for the manual dial indicator + surface plate scenario. I used two AMT102 rotary encoders from another project to create what amounts to a driven SCARA arm that sleeves over a dial indicator (without constraining it in Z), and follows it around a surface plate as an operator takes measurements in Z. At work we frequently log data from dial indicators so I already had a script that would pull data via USB from a cheap iGAGING dial indicator, which amounts to measurement of all 3 axes.
              <br /><br />
              Figuring out the trig was pretty straight forward after remembering law of cosines. There's a caveat though, which is that as soon as your second arm leaves the 180 deg interior angle of the first (and again after 270) you have to make a few small adjustments to the plotting script. This led me to a day wrangling with plots that looked like the one below. You can see all of the trig in twoBarMetrollogyCollection.py. One sort of embarrassing thing to admit is that the plotting script is currently computing the trig for every point, for every frame, because I was lazy about moving from the plotting a complete array to the real time case. I haven't run into any memory limitations yet because most of my plots have been limited to under 2ish minutes.
              <br /><br />

              <h4><br /> An early scan from when I was still smoothing out some of the trig issues.</h4>
              <br />
              This project was my first time using matplotlib's animation features (which is really just iteratively plotting then clearing over a given time interval). It made the move from plotting a single array of points to actually animating it in real time pretty straightforward. There are 3 scripts:
              <ul>
                <li>twoBarMetrologyCSVGenerator - Creates and populates a .csv of Time, Angle1, Angle2, Deflection.</li>
                <li>twoBarMetrologyCollection - Converts .csv to cartesian coordinates and heatmaps.</li>
                <li>twoBarMetrology_CurveFitting - Plots points in 3D and fits a plane to the surface using least squares. Also plots a histogram of point to plane distances and outputs surface flatness, parallelism, and angle.</li>
              </ul>              
              <img class="imageInline" alt="#" src=" https://portfoliowebsite.s3.amazonaws.com/2bar/2barthumbnail.jpg">
              <h4><br /> twoBarMetrologyCollection generates a heatmap of surface height while dynamically updating max and min heights + linkage position (the two lines in gold) in real time.</h4>
              <img class="imageInline" alt="#" src=" https://portfoliowebsite.s3.amazonaws.com/2bar/2barhistogram.jpg">
              <h4><br /> twoBarMetrology_CurveFitting outputs the two plots above.</h4>
              I scanned a few objects but have yet to use the rig for anything work related. An interesting test I've used to benchmark the jig's performance is to measure the surface of a machined aluminum plate of known flatness, and then put a 6mm gauge block under one end of the same plate, keeping flatness the same, but throwing off parallelism by 6mm. If everything were functioning ideally, the script's flatness estimate should be identical for both scans. Both plots are shown in the video, which nets a flatness deviation of 130 microns (not very impressive accuracy). I am not 100% sure where the error is coming from, but suspect the moment created by the angle might be too much for the dial indicator's bushing (I was scanning upwards and should have been scanning down) and/or the Noga arm I was using also contributed.
              <br /><br />
              One thing this project could really benefit from is a "dead man's switch, where points would cause points to only be logged when the switch was pressed. Currently the rig has to be zeroed every time its started up, and so you have to manually delete noisy points as you can see in the video.
              <br /><br />
              Final ambitions for the project are to switch from the 2 bar linkage to a camera and some openCV to track the top of the dial indicator around the table. Then points could be plotted over an actual still frame of the part being inspected, which would probably be a much more compelling way to send information back to a vendor (particularly if their serial number was visible on the part).

          <figcaption>CVDAQ</figcaption>
          <figcaption class="thumbnailSubText">CVDAQ is a computer vision data acquisition tool that allows users to film static sensors with visible DROs while using computer vision and optical character recognition to log data to a .csv file. <a href=" https://youtu.be/S21aSRrQoiY">You can see a video of it running here.</a> While working on a personal project that involved plotting force vs. displacement of a linear stage, I found myself spending hours manually logging values from a dial indicator and force gauge to a spreadsheet. I found it was easiest to film the setup, move the stage continuously, then return and log all of the data from the video while playing it slowly. The next logical step was to automate the character recognition.            
            <div class="modalOnly">
              <p>The final script is written in python, and uses a lot of openCV and PyTesseract for the OCR. It works by letting a user upload a video of their test setup, grabbing the first frame, and then asking for rectangles to be drawn around individual regions of interest within a sensor's DRO. The script then iterates through every frame of the video looking within each user generated rectangle. Tesseract also provides a confidence score to each guess, so that gets added as well. This method relies on the camera and sensor being relatively static throughout the test.
              <br /><br />
              Most smartphone cameras shoot at 60 fps, so even if you are rejecting 50% of frames you are still getting 30 fps of data, which is excessive for most of the tests that I run. Unfortunately depending on the DRO, you do wind up with a lot of distorted frames where the DRO was flickering between values. 7 segment displays are one of the better options here. Some of the benefits of data acquisition this way are:
              <ul>
                <li>You have video evidence of every test to go back and look for outliers.</li>
                <li>All of your sensors become perfectly synced, so no worrying about stitching data together from different datetime formats or out of sync data.</li>
                <li>You don't need to know how to program to automate data collection from your sensors (ideal for folks in the sciences who don't have hardware data collection chops)</li>
                <li>Ability to incorporate intangible visual data into a test alongside a sensor. </li>
              </ul>
              There are still a ton of features to add to the project:
              <ul>
                <li>Motion tracking for the digits of interest to support a moving setup.</li>
                <li>An option to select a pixel or area of pixels and plot their color alongside data from other sensors. (useful for LED's that light up on a PCB when a sensor is triggered)</li>
                <li>An option to select analog dial sensors (such as a test indicator or pressure gauge)</li>
              </ul>
              Ultimately I'd like to host the script on a web page such that users can just film their test setup, upload it, and download a .csv of their data. A fun final application for the project would be a closed loop motion control system where a motor is servo'd through a dial indicator being monitored by a camera. In fact you could sort of turn anything into a closed loop system this way. Perhaps someday it will be possible to tape a couple of sensors and actuators on any home appliance or lab equipment, and start optimizing/automating things.

              <h2>5 Bar Linkage Kinematics</h2>
              Around the time when Shaper announced the Origin, I became fixated with finding out how they were achieving XY motion in such a tiny package. Where were the linear rails and lead screws?! After looking through more of their documentation I found the explanation, which is a really unintuitive 5 bar linkage with two nested linkages. For Formlabs' 2018 Hackathon I was planning to build one up and try to get it moving. I was lucky enough to convince 4 others to help with the project, and we made some incredible progress over just 3 days. There were two configurations of the stage that I wanted to make - a ~ 1" x 1" travel version for machining, and a comically lanky version for plotting that could be hung from a whiteboard to draw with. With our 5 person team we wound up making both (see picture below and thumbnail).
             <br /> <br />
             What's especially clever about the Origin's design is that it achieves relatively rigid and accurate (although accuracy is variable) 2 axis motion, without the use of expensive linear motion components such as blocks/rails, belts, or ball screws. Kinematically it's similar to a SCARA, but allows for both motors to be grounded without additional transmission elements, and the added rigidity of having 2 linkages joined at the end effector. Shaper has a particularly compelling case for their implementation. There is no strict requirement to move linearly when you're autocorrecting for a human (we're pretty bad at moving linearly anyways). By limiting their travel to human autocorrect, they can ignore the resolution penalties associated with moving in arcs at 90 deg from inflection. Lastly they nest the bearings for the outer linkages within the inner linkages (see their teardown video or the GIF below of our acrylic version), which allows for a smaller footprint and higher rigidity.
             <br /> <br />
             <img class="imageInline" alt="#" src=" https://portfoliowebsite.s3.amazonaws.com/miscKinematics/5barsmol.gif">
             <h4><br /> A lasercut version of the more rigid version we ultimately machined in aluminum.</h4>
             <br />
             We got  <a href="https://www.michaelfogleman.com/projects/">Michael Fogelman</a> to join the team which feels a lot like an NBA player showing up at your pickup basketball game. He figured out the forward kinematics and handled all of the non firmware level software (+ some of it) and wrote a complete motion control system in just 3 days.
             <br /> <br />
             My final goal for the compact rigid design would be to put one of these stages underneath a vertical tapping machine where you loosely position your hole within a ~1" circle, and the stage positions it underneath the tap with some CV. This would be a neat way to use the mechanism that's still within Shaper's coarse human adjust + fine robot adjust paradigm.
             <br /> <br />
             I also want to write a script that shows the linkage's variable resolution by plotting all of the full steps the robot can take and heat mapping them by distance to adjacent points. Unintuitively the robot has highest resolution when both linkages are fully extended. In looking up how to solve the forward kinematics I found a <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/robotica/article/an-inverse-position-analysis-of-fivebar-planar-parallel-manipulators/E23E448CA4FE157FAC38600C81D1ADDE">neat paper</a> that lays out all of the potential 5-bar revolute/prismatic joint configurations this robot can take, so it would be fun to try the 2x prismatic case someday.
             <br />
             <h2>Parametric XY</h2>
             Another project I'm including here is some robust master modeled parametric CAD for a Core XY that does a decent job of minimizing footprint. I designed the setup for a work friend who was tracking a laser power meter with a galvo driven laser assembly. Core XY's are a neat means to achieve 2 axis motion. They're particularly useful for low inertia high + speed applications, due to the fact that they isolate several high mass components (particularly stepper motors) from their end effector and subsequent axes.
             <br /> <br />

             <h4><br />Form 2's at the time of filming were only capable of driving a single axis at a time.</h4>
             We got it running off of the wipe and peel motors of a Form2. You can find the model sans build platform and Formlabs related paraphernalia <a href="https://portfoliowebsite.s3.amazonaws.com/miscKinematics/ParametricXY.zip">here</a>. It uses some relatively inexpensive standoffs, shoulder screws + bushings, and THK's SRS7-M profile rails (although knockoffs will works as well). I think the layout I've wound up with makes some good compromises between maximizing footprint with respect to travel, mechanical complexity, and rigidity.

          <figcaption class="thumbnailSubText">Older beat up linear motion guides are readily available in my line of work and I've pulled enough out of metal recycling to start grasping for projects to use them in. I decided to turn some into a pair of low profile vises for the mill/soldering/surface plate fixturing. 
            <div class="modalOnly">
              <p>Most machinest's vises use large castings and a lot of mass to ensure rigidity, but the philosophy here is to transmit as much of the clamping load into the base of the machine through the rail as quickly as possible. The moving jaw and nut post index along the mounting holes of the linear rail, so they have a 6" capacity with only 40 mm of stroke. Both the fixed jaw and nut post are mounted from underneath using M4 FHSCS, so the price to pay is that the vises need to be unmounted to adjust capacity. There's a captive nut in a pocket within the moving jaw that attaches to the tightening screw. All of the clamping load goes from the fixed jaw to the nut post, and the linear guide only takes up any moment from off-axis clamping which is relatively low unless you're using parallels.
              <br /><br />
              I made a pair of hard jaws for the vise machined from an old parallel, and another pair of soft jaws from copper for delicate work. All the other components are currently 6061, but someday that will all turn into A2 depending on how useful they are.

          <figcaption class="thumbnailSubText">Polygonal mirrors are often used in scanning applications to raster a laser across a window of limited field of view. Bar code scanners use them by spinning at a known rpm, and inferring line width and spacing through backscattered light intensity. Laserjet printers actively pulse a laser reflected by a polygonal scanning mirror and selectively expose a rotating drum that then picks up ink.
            <div class="modalOnly">
              <p>
                For Formlabs' 2019 Hackathon I was initially planning to build up a polygonal scanning mirror and just make a scanner, but convinced two coworkers to join so we decided to tackle something more challenging. A third relatively common application for polygonal scanning mirrors is to generate topographic maps as a part of a plane's LIDAR. They're a good fit for this application because of the high scanning speed and repeatability of the mirror's single rotational DOF. LIDAR is actually just a pretty straightforward time of flight sensor, no different from ultrasonic distance sensing, but with some quirks (non-visible wavelength + pulse at odd frequencies to create a unmistakable return signal).
                <br /> <br />
                The device we built scanned at 905 nm (non-visible) in a 60 deg vertical window, and was capable of 360 deg rotation. It sort of has to be said that this is not an ideal scanning method for mapping rooms (unless you have things moving incredibly fast). We started with a very promising <a href="https://www.digikey.com/products/en/development-boards-kits-programmers/evaluation-and-demonstration-boards-and-kits/787?k=OPT3101">LIDAR dev kit from TI</a>
                capable of scanning at 4kHz. But couldn't get it working and wound up falling back on a cheap off the shelf sensor called the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14588">TF mini</a>, which we spliced our own laser into.
                <br /> <br />
                Our initial plan to index edges of the hexagonal mirror using the TOF laser failed because we forgot about the fact that the TOF throw signal was only on intermittently. We got the project to a point where we were getting good distance measurements, but poor scans due to intermittent indexing signal. So our continuing engineering goal for the project is to shine a second low power laser (in the visible spectrum) at 100% duty cycle that is used purely to index each time you pass between facets of the polygon. Overall the project was a lot of fun and I got to use some unusual optical equipment, despite not winding up with a working scanner.

              Each part included 5 tool changes and moved through 3 setups to achieve a total machining time of under 2 hours, while minimizing post-production through slot milling for the frames, machining for all hinge mounting hardware, and using extremely tight finishing stepovers. All workholding, part location, and tool changes were integrated directly into the machining process through a series of prompt-driven macros, allowing the parts to be manufactured by any shop employee.

My primary tasks for this project were the redesign of the tool’s Automatic Tool Change System, Dust Foot, and 5-Axis specific changes.

              <h2>Automatic Tool Changer Redesign</h2>
              An ATC, or Automatic Tool Change System, is used by a CNC tool to eliminate the manual steps in a tool change, allowing for rapid production times. I designed and sourced a pneumatics system in collaboration with our vendors for the tool release, positive pressure, and cylinder with precission regulator to balance the weight of the tool’s z-axis. This included an in-house manufactured tool clip (The FEA for this part is shown in the thumbnail) for accepting tool holders when not in use, and changes to the toolbar's design that drastically reduced cost by eliinating a pneumatically actuated dust skirt previously necessary for the ATC.

              <h2>Dust Shoe Redesign </h2>
              I led the redesign and manufacturing worflow for a series of dust shoes compatable with each of ShopBot’s 5 cutting tools. The redesign was backwards compatable and utilized shared non-fabricated parts for all iterations of the dust shoe. The redesign drastically reduced cost by eliminating powdercoated sheet metal parts, maximizing sheet yield, and adding a magnetically removable shroud for ease of use.

          <figcaption>Parametric Climbing Volumes</figcaption>
          <figcaption class="thumbnailSubText">Volumes are geometric structures used in indoor rock climbing gyms that are often bolted to a wall to add additional features and closer imitate the experience of climbing outdoors. Volumes are typically made from plywood and use complex miters cut on a tablesaw to seamlessly mate their sides. Manufacturable geometry is limited by factors such maximum miter angle, tablesaw size, and skill of the manufacturer. Large production runs pose particular difficulty due to the setup and calculations necessary to maximize material yield.  
            <div class="modalOnly">
              <p>
              Climbing volumes are primarily sold pre-assembled, which typically includes a finish coat of paint or epoxy, mixed with an aggregate material to provide gripping texture. Holes for screw in t-nuts are also added, and are used for bolting additional holds to the volume. Depending on volume geometry, final volume (length^3 in this case) can increase by an order of magnitude in comparison to flat packed volume which effects shipping costs.

              <h4>Animation showing parameter adjustments made to a 4-sided polyhedron. Not shown is the flat-pattern geometry and toolpaths adjusting in real-time.</h4>               
              I have modeled several of the most common climbing volumes parametrically, such that custom volumes of any desired dimension can be generated. The volumes are then copied and mated flat to a 4x8’ sheet of pywood. Parameters can be updated resulting in the 3D model of the volume to update, but also the flat pattern in real time, allowing for efficient nesting. The most novel aspect of this project is that the miters are cut through a 3D offset carving operation by a CNC tool, allowing for unrestricted convex miter angles to be cut. Edge quality is directly proportional to stepover, but a stepover of 0.03” has been found to work well for a 45 deg miter, which can be cut rapidly and in a single operation. With adequate vacuum hold-down, tabs were not found to be necesary, and parts can come directly off of the tool ready for glue-up and assembly. The greatest benefit of this process comes in maximizing nesting efficieny, resulting in more efficient material use.
              <br /> <br />
              In the summer of 2017 I cut a pair of volumes and after assembling and finishing, donated them to my local gym. Since then I have sold several sets to local gyms as well as friends with an at-home bouldering gym.
              <br /> <br />
              Models for this project can be found <a href="http://a360.co/2g5YVIO">here</a>, and if you are interested in cutting some volumes of your own/parametric modeling in Fusion 360 in general, or app development with the API feel free to get in touch via email!
              <br /> <br />
              Future goals for this project are to develop a complete Fusion-360 add-in, and eventually a web interface where customers can generate custom volumes of their own in real time.

          <figcaption class="thumbnailSubText">This project started after acquiring a motor from a friend who used to work in the EV industry.  The motor is an original Turnigy 80-100 130kV outrunner BLDC that has a following on forums like endless sphere, despite being discontinued in 2011. It is being run at 36V nominal using 5 <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/BALANCING-SCOOTER-LG-36V-4-4AH-LITHIUM-ION-REPLACEMENT-BATTERY-PACK-6-5-8-10-/172648854096">Alarm Hookup</a> Samsung 18650 packs, each with a 4.4 AH capacity for a total of 22 AHs (or a range of about 53 miles at 20 mph on flat land).
            <div class="modalOnly">
              <p>
              The motor is controlled with a <a href="http://vedder.se/2015/01/vesc-open-source-esc/">VESC</a>, which is a neat open-source speed controller originally designed for DIY electric skateboards. VESC's can push up to 50A continuous at 60V which is significantly more power than I need (I am pulling about 26A at 30 mph which is about as fast as I feel comfortable on a bike). The VESC also has a 5V BEC and is capable of reading resistive or hall effect throttles, which would otherwise have to be overcome with an arduino or servo-tester circuit. VESCs are also capable of some neat functions including regenerative braking and FOC control which I am looking forward to experimenting more with.
              </br></br>
              The motor is mounted between the seat stays and seat tube and is geared down to the rear wheel with a 2-stage HTD 5mm timing belt reduction of about 10.6:1. The large plywood rear pulley is located concentrically with the hub of the rear wheel and zip tied to the spokes of the wheel (so far it has held up well!). Over the course of working on this project I moved to New York City and had to leave behind the original bike the project was intended for (a vintage steel frame Peugeot road bike), but was able to adapt it to a new bike in New York with some minor machining. My original design had a roller bearing idler which mounted to one of the seat-stays, but the new bike was slightly larger and allowed for 1050 mm rear timing belt to be tensioned at the motor mounting bracket.

              <p>
                Three weeks before the conference, initial plans to ship a gantry-style indexer were canceled due to size constraints of the building’s service elevator. I began working on adapting the Indexer to the Desktop Max and had a working prototype
                in two weeks time. The prototype was used as a part of a 3 day workshop in collaboration with a team from University of Minnesota’s DesignFab entitled “Exploring the Fourth Dimension.” <br /> <br /> After positive
                feedback from the event and several several customer inquiries, I adapted the prototype to a production ready design, which is sold as a standard product for ShopBot’s Desktop line of CNC tools. The Desktop Max 6” Indexer is also used
                frequently by ShopBot to demonstrate rotary CNC work both in house and on the road.

              After sourcing a compatible tangential knife, I designed, built, and tested a prototype of this product for a customer requiring a custom dual-z machine, capable of both cutting and machining material up to 4” thick. The final tool was capable of switching between tangential knife and machining operations mid-toolpath, and the tool handling for the knife was integrated directly into the ShopBot control system.
              <br /> <br />
              This project involved a variety of custom electrical and mechanical hardware. I also worked closely with software engineering to develop a secondary post-processor to add tangential 4th axis motion to native ShopBot code when the tangential knife was called.

              <p>
              The final design lowered cost and build time by integrating PEM hardware in several places and shifting complexity in parts from powder coated steel sheet to an uncoated aluminum. The redesign also oriented the tool’s drivers vertically to allow for more efficient natural convection across the rear of the tray which doubles as a heatsink.
              <br /> <br />
              The redesign allowed for an additional row of aluminum decking to be installed at the rear of the tool, such that an Automatic tool changing system, Fixed Z-Zero Plate or Indexer/other accessory could be mounted permanently to the tool without sacrificing work area, or to utilize an additional 2” of machining area. The changes have since been incorporated into ShopBot’s 24” x 18” Desktop redesign. 
              <br /> <br />
              I used a prototype of the redesigned tray in a custom modular CNC controller that I built for my personal machine, but the design can be used pretty generally for building CNC enclosures using Gecko G250X drivers and ShopBot’s Desktop control board.

              The screenshot above shows the add-in's GUI which allows for the selection of custom post processors, posting of Folders, Setups, and individual Operations. The current prototype version of the add-in will search the network for a single tool network connected tool (doesn't currently work for AP mode), automatically post process the selected CAM files and launch a browser with the found tool.

          <figcaption class="thumbnailSubText">A quick tool change spindle has the capability to swap tool holders using an HSK taper and set screw, preserving tool length offsets between tool changes. This allows for an operator to program for the correct tool offset, instead of re-measuring tool length between each tool change.
            <div class="modalOnly">
              <p>
                In visual basic, I programmed a tool handler that created a database of tools for the quick change spindle and applied offsets, including options for dual-z spindles, as well as fixed z-zero plates. The handler was fully integrated into ShopBot’s control system and is currently in use on two custom machines.

          <figcaption class="thumbnailSubText">Customer facing 5-axis machining project that focused on trimming of excess flashing for carbon fiber parts. Part location and hold down were achieved through a vacuum mold system that simultaneously located and held down parts in a single process. The final workflow involved 6 distinct contour swarf cuts (both for the flashing and several through holes) over 2 setups, in full 5-axis motion programmed in HSM CAM.

The kit has come with me to Mongolia, China, Dubai, Hawaii, and many other job sites in the continental US. When not on the road, the foam inserts of the case can be removed and placed in drawers for accessibility.
