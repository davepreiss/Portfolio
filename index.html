Each part included 5 tool changes and moved through 3 setups to achieve a total machining time of under 2 hours, while minimizing post-production through slot milling for the frames, machining for all hinge mounting hardware, and using extremely tight finishing stepovers. All workholding, part location, and tool changes were integrated directly into the machining process through a series of prompt-driven macros, allowing the parts to be manufactured by any shop employee.

          <figcaption class="thumbnailSubText">In preparation for the 2016 Annual Furniture Society Conference, I designed and built a CNC tool capable of turning parts up to 8” in diameter and 36” in length, while utilizing the small form factor and high accuracy of ShopBot’s Desktop Max.
            <div class="modalOnly">
              <p>
                With just three weeks before the conference, initial plans to ship a gantry-style indexer were canceled due to size constraints of the building’s service elevator. I began working on adapting the Indexer to the Desktop Max and had a working prototype
                in two weeks time. The prototype was used as a part of a 3 day workshop in collaboration with a team from University of Minnesota’s DesignFab entitled “Exploring the Fourth Dimension.” <br /> <br /> After positive
                feedback from the event and several several customer inquiries, I adapted the prototype to a production ready design, which is sold as a standard product for ShopBot’s Desktop line of CNC tools. The Desktop Max 6” Indexer is also used
                frequently by ShopBot to demonstrate rotary CNC work both in house and on the road.

            <div class="modalOnly">
              <p>
After sourcing a compatible tangential knife, I designed, built, and tested a prototype of this product for a customer requiring a custom dual-z machine, capable of both cutting and machining material up to 4” thick. The final tool was capable of switching between tangential knife and machining operations mid-toolpath, and the tool handling for the knife was integrated directly into the ShopBot control system.
<br /> <br />
This project involved a variety of custom electrical and mechanical hardware. I also worked closely with software engineering to develop a secondary post-processor to add tangential 4th axis motion to native ShopBot code when the tangential knife was called.

            <div class="modalOnly">
              <p>
The final design lowered cost and build time by integrating PEM hardware in several places and shifting complexity in parts from powder coated steel sheet to an uncoated aluminum. The redesign also oriented the tool’s drivers vertically to allow for more efficient natural convection across the rear of the tray which doubles as a heatsink.
<br /> <br />
The redesign allowed for an additional row of aluminum decking to be installed at the rear of the tool, such that an Automatic tool changing system, Fixed Z-Zero Plate or Indexer/other accessory could be mounted permanently to the tool without sacrificing work area, or just utilize an additional 2” of machining area. The changes have since been incorporated into ShopBot’s 24” x 18” Desktop redesign. 
<br /> <br />
I used a prototype of the redesigned tray in a custom modular CNC controller that I built for my personal machine, but the design can be used pretty generally for building CNC enclosures using Gecko G250X drivers and ShopBot’s Desktop control board.

After building the bench top, I added the loft shown below, and fabricated a pair of steel legs inspired by mid-century style hairpin legs. Design constraints for the legs were that be strong enough to support two sitters, and that their fastening points be hidden when looking at the bench from above. The final design achieves this by bracketing to each slat individually, which also helps in distrubuting load accross the depth of the bench. I built the legs with help from <a href="http://arpdesignstudio.com/content/">ARP Design.</a> In the future I hope to publish a more detailed walkthrough for this build, but have made the models available below!</br></br>

          <figcaption class="thumbnailSubText">I designed the pressure sensitive z-zero plate after building a custom z-zero plate that replaced the alligator clip associated with many CNC router z-zero plates with steel wool (and eventually carbon fiber brushes). The collet or shaft of the bit would contact the brush (carrying ground) during a z-plunge, while the tip of the bit would contact a machined aluminum surface carrying the z-zero plate input. The distance from that machined surface to the material or tool surface could then be used to establish cutter length between tool changes.

Design constraints for the final product were that it be backwards compatible with all existing ShopBots, repeatable to within +/- 0.001” of an inch, and be able to used to zero directly to the surface of material to be machined, as well as mounted in a fixed location to zero to table surface.

          <figcaption>Parametric Climbing Volumes</figcaption>
          <figcaption class="thumbnailSubText">Volumes are geometric structures used in indoor rock climbing gyms that are often bolted to a wall to add additional features and closer imitate the experience of climbing outdoors. Volumes are typically made from plywood and use complex miters cut on a tablesaw to seamlessly mate their sides. Manufacturable geometry is limited by factors such maximum miter angle, tablesaw size, and skill of the manufacturer. Large production runs pose particular difficulty due to the setup and calculations necessary to maximize material yield.  
            <div class="modalOnly">
              <p>
Climbing volumes are primarily sold pre-assembled, which typically includes a finish coat of paint or epoxy, mixed with an aggregate material to provide gripping texture. Holes for screw in t-nuts are also added, and are used for bolting additional holds to the volume. Depending on volume geometry, final volume (length^3 in this case) can increase by an order of magnitude in comparison to flat packed volume which effects shipping costs.
<br /> <br />
                
            <img class="imageInline" alt="#" src=" https://s3.amazonaws.com/portfoliowebsite/Volume/Volume+Cycle.gif">   
                <h4>Animation showing parameter adjustments made to a 4-sided polyhedron. Not shown is the flat-pattern geometry and toolpaths adjusting in real-time.</h4>    
                
I have modeled several of the most common climbing volumes parametrically, such that custom volumes of any desired dimension can be generated. The volumes are then copied and mated flat to a 4x8’ sheet of pywood. Parameters can be updated resulting in the 3D model of the volume to update, but also the flat pattern in real time, allowing for efficient nesting. The most novel aspect of this project is that the miters are cut through a 3D offset carving operation by a CNC tool, allowing for unrestricted convex miter angles to be cut. Edge quality is directly proportional to stepover, but a stepover of 0.03” has been found to work well for a 45 deg miter, which can be cut rapidly and in a single operation. With adequate vacuum hold-down, tabs were not found to be necesary, and parts can come directly off of the tool ready for glue-up and assembly. The greatest benefit of this process comes in maximizing nesting efficieny, resulting in more efficient material use.
<br /> <br />
In the summer of 2017 I cut a pair of volumes and after assembling and finishing, donated them to my local gym. Since then I have sold several sets to local gyms as well as friends with an at-home bouldering gym.
<br /> <br />
Models for this project can be found <a href="http://a360.co/2g5YVIO">here</a>, and if you are interested in cutting some volumes of your own/parametric modeling in Fusion 360 in general, or app development with the API feel free to get in touch via email!
<br /> <br />
Future goals for this project are to develop a complete Fusion-360 add-in, and eventually a web interface where customers can generate custom volumes of their own in real time.

An ATC, or Automatic Tool Change System, is used by a CNC tool to eliminate the manual steps in a tool change, allowing for rapid production times. I designed and sourced a pneumatic system for the tool release, positive pressure, and cylinder with precission regulator to balance the weight of the tool’s z-axis. This included an in-house manufactured tool clip for accepting tool holders when not in use, and a novel toolbar layout that drastically reduced cost by eliinating a pneumatically actuated dust skirt previously necessary for the ATC.

<h2>Dust Shoe Redesign </h2>
I led the redesign and manufacturing worflow for a series of dust shoes compatable with each of ShopBot’s 5 cutting tools. The redesign was backwards compatable and utilized shared non-fabricated parts for all iterations of the dust shoe. The redesign drastically reduced cost by eliminating powdercoated sheet metal parts, maximizing sheet yield, and adding a magnetically removable shroud for ease of use.

This included a new Z-axis cable carrier, proximity switch mounting and their associated macros, cable lengths and management.

This preserves the tool length offset between tool changes, allowing for an operator to program for the correct tool offset, instead of re-measuring tool length between each tool change.

              <p>
                In visual basic, I programmed the tool handler that created a database of tools for the quick change spindle and applied offsets, including options for dual-z spindles, as well as fixed z-zero plates. The handler was fully integrated into ShopBot’s control system and is currently in use on two custom machines.

          <figcaption class="thumbnailSubText">Customer facing 5-axis machining project that focused on trimming of excess flashing for carbon fiber parts. Part location and hold down were achieved through a vacuum mold system that simultaneously located and held down the parts in a single process. The final workflow involved 6 distinct contour swarf cuts (both for the flashing and several through holes) over 2 setups, in full 5-axis motion programmed in HSM CAM.

          <figcaption class="thumbnailSubText">I am continuously working on a home automation system built around Amazon's Alexa AI. It is currently capable of opening and closing a set of curtains using voice commands. I designed and built the IOT’d curtain using an arduino, 5V servo, and a pair of limit switches (the curtains are timing belt driven). After the initial prototype, I added web functionality using the Particle Photon and linked it to an Amazon Dot using IFTT. Videos to come!
            <div class="modalOnly">
              <p>
               The final design can be linked directly to my alarm, or activated discreetly by voice. The entire mechanism can be unmounted from the wall and used for  non-precise linear motion applications such as as a camera dolly.

          <figcaption class="thumbnailSubText">Scrap CNC is a 3-axis CNC tool that I built over the course of 4 months and 2 years of collecting material from the scrap bin. The final machine is constructed primarily from aluminum extrusion and uses 15mm profile linear rails, 4 NEMA 23 stepper driven lead screws, and a 1 HP HSD Spindle. The tool can be disassembled into 3 components and carried easily by 1 person. Total travel is 24.5 x 19.5 x 8.

                Future plans for this tool are a low RPM spindle, rotary axis, and eventually a design review discussing the machine’s features (and limitations!).
